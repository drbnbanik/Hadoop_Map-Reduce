Google nGram Standard Deviation
===============================

The data set is the same as in the Google nGram example. The objective was to compute in mapreduce the standard deviation of all 
volume values (across all records and both files). The output should be a single value. Also it should be done by using no 
more than 2 mapreduce jobs.
